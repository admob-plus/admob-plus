#### This is a fork of the original plugin admob-plus

I dedicate a considerable amount of my free time to developing and maintaining many cordova plugins for the community ([See the list with all my maintained plugins][community_plugins]).
To help ensure this plugin is kept updated,
new features are added and bugfixes are implemented quickly,
please donate a couple of dollars (or a little more if you can stretch) as this will help me to afford to dedicate time to its maintenance.
Please consider donating if you're using this plugin in an app that makes you money,
or if you're asking for new features or priority bug fixes. Thank you!

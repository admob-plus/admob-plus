It is [a long way](https://github.com/admob-plus/admob-plus/compare/cordova-admob-plus@0.42.0...admob-plus-cordova@1.0.0) to reach the 1.0 release.

```js
480 commits, 730 files changed, 16341 insertions(+), 24085 deletions(-)
```

1.0 is a serious rewrite of its internals and APIs to utilize the [recently updated](https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/migration) and [upcoming](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/migration) Google AdMob SDK.

Apart from the usual Cordova plugin, AdMob Plus is now officially providing plugins for [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) and [Capacitor v3](https://capacitorjs.com/).

## Cordova Plugin

Package of Cordova plugin has been renamed from [`cordova-admob-plus`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-admob-plus) to [`admob-plus-cordova`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/admob-plus-cordova).
This keeps [@ionic-native/admob-plus](https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/admob-plus) working without breaking.

`cordova-admob-plus` is now deprecated in favor of the new plugin, Ionic users should transit to use [`@admob-plus/ionic`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@admob-plus/ionic) for the latest improvements.

[Documentation](https://admob-plus.github.io/docs/cordova)

### TypeScript Support

`admob-plus-cordova` exports types for TypeScript projects.

Use Triple-slash directives to have global `admob` object typed,

```ts
/// <reference types="community-admob-plus-cordova" />
```

Regular import works too,

```ts
import { BannerAd } from 'admob-plus-cordova'

let banner: BannerAd
```

### Multiple Ad Instances

It is now to manage multiple instances of the same ad format, thanks to the new API design.

```ts
const banner1 = admob.BannerAd({...})
const banner2 = admob.BannerAd({...})
```

### Rewarded Interstitial Ad

As part fo utilizing the SDK, new ad format [`Rewarded Interstitial Ad`](https://admob-plus.github.io/docs/cordova/ads/rewarded-interstitial) is added.

### App Tracking Transparency

`requestTrackingAuthorization()` was part of [`cordova-plugin-consent`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-consent), is now moved to `admob-plus-cordova`,

```ts
admob.requestTrackingAuthorization()
```

While you could [consider using it or not](https://admob-plus.github.io/docs/cordova/faq#shoud-i-use-apples-att-prompt), this makes ATT integration much easier.

### API Docs

[API docs](https://admob-plus.github.io/docs/cordova/api) are automatically generated from source code to provide up-to-date reference to classes, methods and interfaces.

## Ionic Plugin

The Ionic community has maintained [`@ionic-native/admob-plus`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ionic-native/admob-plus) for some time, it is hard to keep changes in sync with wrapping Cordova plugin due to the difference of release cycle.

By officially maintaining the Ionic plugin [`@admob-plus/ionic`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@admob-plus/ionic), the API and documentation will always be up-to-date.

[Documentation](https://admob-plus.github.io/docs/ionic)

## Capacitor Plugin

Capacitor 3 is around the corner, [`@admob-plus/capacitor`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@admob-plus/capacitor) provides familiar AdMob Plus APIs for those want to try it out.

## GitHub Sponsors

I have setup the [Funding page](https://admob-plus.github.io/funding) since the project start to subsidize my open source work.

By adding [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/ratson) option, I wish there will be more recurring support.

## Thank You

I would like to take the chance to say thank you to [all contributors](https://github.com/admob-plus/admob-plus/graphs/contributors), especially to all sponsors supporting my work financially.

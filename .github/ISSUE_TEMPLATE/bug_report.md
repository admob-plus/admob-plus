  To help identify if a problem is specific to a platform, browser, or module version, information about your environment is required.
  This enables the maintainers quickly reproduce the issue and give feedback.

  Run the following command in your project folder in terminal.
  Note: The result is copied to your clipboard directly.

  `npx admob-plus info --clipboard`

  What happens if you skip this step?

  We will try to help you, but in many cases it is impossible because crucial
  information is missing. In that case we'll tag an issue as having a low priority,
  and eventually close it if there is no clear direction.

  We still appreciate the report though, as eventually somebody else might
  create a reproducible example for it.

  Thanks for helping us help you!
